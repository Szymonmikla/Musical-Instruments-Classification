# Musical-Instruments-Classification
Classificator for musical instruments made with deep neural networks.

The implemented Music Instrument Classification System is an application that allows sorting audio files based on predicted instruments. The program is based on three neural network models trained to:

Recognize the type of instrument: harmonic and percussive,
Recognize harmonic instruments,
Recognize percussive instruments.

Supported Instruments
Harmonic Instruments: Cello, Clarinet, Flute, Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Organ, Piano, Saxophone, Trumpet, Violin, Voice.
Percussive Instruments: Cymbals, Hi Hats, Kicks, Snares.

Data Sources
The data used in the model training comes from two main sources, with a focus on the IRMAS dataset. The data for the percussive set was collected from various sources, including free percussive sample packs found online.
